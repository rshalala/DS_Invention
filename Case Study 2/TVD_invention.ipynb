    "<font size=\"+1\">\"Kids R' Us\" toystore have decided to produce a new small and huge toy packs that contain different kinds of air, land, and water animals. The small pack contains 30 pieces, and the huge pack contains 150 pieces. According to the company's policy, the distribution of the kind of animals in each pack should be as close as possible to a uniformly distributed pack. That is, if possible, each pack should contain the same number of pieces for each type of toy (e.g. 10 air, 10 land, and 10 water, in a small pack) or as close as possible to that.<br>\n",
    "The packs are produced by a dedicated machine that is sometimes unsuccessful in producing the exact amount of pieces it should. As part of the company's distribution team, you are responsible for deciding which packs to approve for distribution to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"+1\">The company's management staff seeks your help in deciding which of the following cases should be approved for distribution:"
